- **Redirection**

## 3. Email Verification (Custom Django Feature)
## Description

This project implements **email verification** as part of the user registration process. After a user registers, a confirmation email is sent with a verification link. Only verified users are allowed to log in and access their account.

---

###  How It Works

1. **User Registers**
   - User submits the registration form via `/account/register/`.
   
2. **Verification Email Sent**
   - A unique verification link is sent to the user‚Äôs email using Django's `send_mail()` function and `default_token_generator`.

3. **User Verifies Account**
   - When the user clicks the link, their account is marked as verified.

4. **Login Enabled**
   - Only verified users can log in through `/account/login/`.

---

### Files Involved

- `views.py`  
  Handles registration, email sending, and token validation.
  
- `urls.py`  
  Maps verification URLs like `verify/<uidb64>/<token>/`.

- `register.html`  
  Registration form.

- `email_verification.html`  
  Template used for sending email content (if HTML email is used).

###  Change Password
- Users can change their password while logged in.
- Old password is required to ensure security.
- New password must meet Django‚Äôs password validation rules.
- After changing the password:
  - The user is immediately logged in with the new password.
  - A success message is shown.

###  Tech Used
- Django‚Äôs built-in `UserChangeForm`, `PasswordChangeForm`, and authentication views.
- `@login_required` decorator to restrict access to logged-in users only.
